# vscode-profile-shuffler

An attempt to make a vscode extension to move extensions between vscode profiles, for which I could see no easy way.

Hacked together with github co-pilot

Usage:

1. Ctrl-Shift-P
2. Move Extensions
3. Enter target profile name (can't find a way to list profiles, patches welcome)
4. Choose extensions to move
5. Press okay to move extensions to new profile
